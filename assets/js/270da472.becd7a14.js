peak events. By optimizing battery charging and discharging, the Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy enables efficient energy allocation while respecting user state-of-charge objectives and grid constraints. This section presents the MPC formulation for the electric storage device, which balances energy cost, user comfort, and battery operational limits. The formulation is based on predictive modeling to anticipate battery behavior over a time horizon, allowing proactive power peak management during service restoration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Devices/electric_vehicle_v1g_mpc":{"id":"Devices/electric_vehicle_v1g_mpc","title":"Electric Vehicle V1G MPC","description":"The electric vehicle (EV) is an important component of modern residential energy systems, contributing to power demand during charging, especially in highly electrified homes subject to Demand Response (DR) events. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation for the EV optimizes charging to maintain a desired State of Charge (SoC) while respecting grid power constraints and user preferences, such as EV availability for charging. This section presents the EV MPC formulation in V1G mode (charging only), which uses a binary switch to control charging based on a branched profile indicating when the EV is connected. This approach enables efficient power allocation during service restoration, enhancing grid stability and integration with Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Devices/helper":{"id":"Devices/helper","title":"Device Helper","description":"This module provides a utility class, DeviceHelper, for managing and categorizing devices.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Devices/space_heating_mpc":{"id":"Devices/space_heating_mpc","title":"Space Heating","description":"Space heating, implemented as a smart thermostat, is a key component of residential energy systems, especially in cold climates where heating needs contribute significantly to Demand Response (DR). The Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation for heating optimizes the temperature in multiple thermal zones of a dwelling, ensuring occupant comfort while respecting grid power constraints. This section presents the heating MPC formulation, which considers thermal dynamics, occupancy schedules, and external disturbances such as weather conditions. By prioritizing occupied zones and limiting power peaks, the formulation enhances DR and integrates seamlessly with Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Devices/water_heater_mpc":{"id":"Devices/water_heater_mpc","title":"Water Heater","description":"The water heater is an essential component in residential energy systems, especially in highly electrified homes where it significantly contributes to power demand during Demand Response (DR) events.

These unforeseen loads can lead to grid capacity exceedance, risking the triggering of protection mechanisms and subsequent outages. Real-Time Control (RTC) acts as a real-time monitor, continuously observing energy consumption and dynamically adjusting controllable loads to enforce the power limit in case of unexpected overloads. This section presents the RTC formulation, which relies on real-time measurements and an inverse priority mechanism to maintain grid stability and enhance the reliability of residential energy management systems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thermal Model/learn_thermal_model":{"id":"Thermal Model/learn_thermal_model","title":"Learn Thermal Model","description":"This module defines the LearnThermalDynamics class, which manages the learning, validation, and persistence of thermal models for space heating.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thermal Model/thermal_models":{"id":"Thermal Model/thermal_models","title":"Thermal Models","description":"This class provides the optimization models used to execute the learning of the thermal models.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Utils/logging":{"id":"Utils/logging","title":"Logging","description":"This module provides a centralized utility for configuring and managing application logging.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
