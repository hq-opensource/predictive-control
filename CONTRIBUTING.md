# Contribution Policy

We thank you for considering contributing to one of HQ’s open source projects. We firmly believe that open source thrives on collaboration and community engagement. Your contributions, whether they involve code, documentation, or project improvements, are essential to its evolution and success.

This policy aims to facilitate and guide your contributions to ensure smooth and effective collaboration among all participants.

## 1. Code of Conduct

HQ is committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive community. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. A copy is available in a separate project file. Any inappropriate behavior may result in actions, including exclusion from the project.

## 2. How to Contribute?

Contributions to HQ’s projects can be made through Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

### 2.1. Issues

Issues are used to report problems, request new features, or discuss potential project enhancements before submitting a Pull Request.

When submitting a new issue, please keep the following principles in mind:  
- Check existing issues before creating a new one.  
- Provide as much information as possible to help maintainers understand and reproduce the problem.  
- If an issue already exists for your concern, add your comments and relevant information instead of creating a new one.  
- To report a security vulnerability, please create an issue with the appropriate label.

### 2.2. Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull Requests are the primary way to propose changes to the project. To ensure an effective review process, please follow these principles:  
- Your Pull Request should focus on a single change (e.g., fixing a bug or adding a feature, but not both).  
- Add or update unit and integration tests related to your change.  
- Update the documentation if your change affects the project’s usage.  
- A Pull Request may require approvals from multiple project maintainers before being merged.

To submit a Pull Request, follow these steps:  
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.  
- Clone the project.  
- Create a separate branch with a descriptive name for your change.  
- Make your changes and commit them.  
- Ensure your code adheres to the project’s standards (formatting, tests, linting, etc.).  
- Push your changes to your fork.  
- Create a Pull Request to the main repository, following the project’s guidelines.  

For major changes or those likely to impact critical features, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss them before submitting a Pull Request.

## 3. Getting Help

If you need support or wish to engage with project maintainers, creating an issue is the best approach. A maintainer will strive to respond as promptly as possible.
